<!--- old about me
I am a product design engineer with a background in mechanical engineering. My identity as a
  first generation latina has shaped my mission in design, one that centers empathy and human centered design. Growing up ,
  I witnessed how my community and other marginilized communities are often left out of conversations within design and how few products were available to meet their needs.
   This is what has made me passionate to remedy this imbalance by innovating new consumer products to create a more equitable world.
   I want to design accessible products that empower users and create meaningful experiences -->

            <h4>What is a critical maker?</h4>
            Critical maker stemming from critical making , creates computational expierences that
            critically explore social and culturally relevant themes. It extendes critical thinking , normally
            presented in abstract linguistic terms, to making , something physical and hands on.
            I have extended and redrawn this definition to entail activism , design and education.
            Explore some projects below.

            allows users to interact and push critical social reflection for the maker and the user.
            combining critical thinking , critical design , and critical making , extended from its orignial definition
            critical social refelction , sociological lens , provocation , ("critical thinking with hands on making")
            link it to a physical and allowing the user to interact ("critical thinking as cogniticily individualistic & making material tacit .external and community oriented ; introducing
            hands to scholars working in langauge and texts ; pushes users into mire complex emotional and psychological territory questioning social norms//(status quo)")
