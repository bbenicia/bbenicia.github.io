                <p align="justify">I am a product design engineer with a background in mechanical engineering. My identity as a
                  first generation latina has shaped my mission in design, one that centers empathy and human centered design. Growing up ,
                  I witnessed how my community and other marginilized communities are often left out of conversations within design and how few products were available to meet their needs.
                   This is what has made me passionate to remedy this imbalance by innovating new consumer products to create a more equitable world.
                   I want to design accessible products that empower users and create meaningful experiences <br>
                    <br> A little more about me is that I have a strong DIY ethos that has pushed me to learn new tools and gain a variety of skills within digital and
                    physical spaces. In my free time, I love to make animations, produce music , and make unique gifts for my friends and family. I am interested in exploring
                    game design more and hope make a full game in the future. </p>
