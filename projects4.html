          <h7>Introduction</h7>
          <p>As visual thinkers, molecular models are especially useful
            as educational tools to show simple building blocks that
            ultimately construct a complex molecular structure. This
            project aimed to present an accurate translation of a
            cis-structured peptoid nanosheet and helix.The models are
             built to self-assemble, which aims to illustrate and mimic
             self-assembly in nature through natural intermolecular
             interactions into its most stable structure. These models
             will provide more opportunities for interaction and exploration,
              which helps engage more users in the process.</p>

            <h7> My Role </h7>
            <p> I worked on this project under the mentorhsip of Ron Zuckermann as
            a reserach intern for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My job was to
            and discover a way to design and prototype macroscopic models that would
            accurately depict the self assembly of peptoids in order to create an
            interactive educational experience. My design process entailed ideating models
            and mechanical formation , modeling on CAD software, creating unique key slot joints,
            3-D printing, tolerancing , prototyping and iterating . </p>

             <p>In order to design an authentic product that would truly represent what
             was happening at the molecular level, I looked at ramachandran plots to see acceptable pairs
             of dihedral angles. Once the appropriate angleâ€™s range was obtained , the structures were modeled
             in a molecule visualization software, various angle pairs were tried out to get the most
             linear or straight helix and sheet within the acceptable range. Once the molecule was built,
             the peptoid was deconstructed to its fundamental backbone. This was done by creating nitrogen
             trace using vectors from each Nitrogen. </p>

          <p>(1) The nanosheet is made up of two building blocks that are mirror images of each other.
          The interconnections are comprised of two reversible slot combination. Slots can not be symmetirc
           about the x and y axis or be a squeeze fit joint.optimized the slot design to ensure other slots
            do not go into other slots. Facilitated self assembly with appropriate toleraces and drafts.</p>

          <!-- photo -->
          <p>(2) Unlike the nanosheet, the helix is only made up of one building block. Therefore there is only one unique reversible interconnection in the design. Slots can also not be symmetric about the x and y axis and can not be a squeeze fit joint.</p>
