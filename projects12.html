                  <span class="importantwords">Do you find yourself jumping to the beat of the music in the rain? Are rainy days the best days
                  to reflect and listen to music?Do you add rain background music on top of the music you are listening?</span>
                  The weather influences our emotions and state of being.I wanted to highlight performance as expression and reflection through
                  the vessel of music. For me , the weather , specifically rain has
                  always inspired me and been a time for self meditation and introspection. It is the days I feel most in tune with myself
                  and can focus on myself. This lends itself to prime musical creation and expression. Whatever the Weather is a weather inspired
                  digital musical instrument  that encourages users to embrace the weather and use it as inspiration to make new compositions. Simply put it is essentially a weather themed sequencer.
                  Whether used as a purposeful introspective instrument that users can reflect and self mediate with , or something to do when stuck inside due to being rained
                  in or snowed in, this digital musical instrument provides different modes of interactions.  The user can control
                  “temperature” or  “different weather patterns”(thunder, rain) through hardware controls
                    (buttons,pressure sensor, etc) that map onto different sonic results. Visual feedback
                    is provided for the execution of these controls through LEDs.

                  <p class="projectpitch">
                    All sounds in my instrument were created by me in abelton and input into max as samples. For the sound design , I wanted to create ambient
                    textured twinkly sounds for light rain and deeper lower octave fuller sounds for the hard rain. Hard and small thudner would have a crashing, noisy , distorted sound
                    of varrying degrees. The Max code is fairly simple ,mainly consisting of arduino max serial communication , and sampling processing.

            <h8> Physical Design: The Cloud Box </h8> <br><br>
            <p>The physical design of the box was very important. I wanted it to look like a cloud box , and try my best to have a high fielity prototype of what the final product would look like.
            I lasercut using white and clear acrylic. The clear acylic was used for the top and bottom of the box , while white acrylic was used for the sides to provide a nice contrast and give a more
          sleeker look. The transparent was to fit the aesthetic of the product , allow users to look inside , and give focus to the rgb lights. Looking down on the box is a large layerd clouds , that I lasercut, with an led matrix
         below it. I etched any words and symbols on , such as the thermometer temperatures</p>
         <br>
            <h8> Desiging Product Interactions </h8> <br><br>
            I put alot of thought into the desiging the product interactions and how it would support the feelings I wanted the users to have and the way that would provide the best interactions. I thought alot about button placement and
            mapping and felt that there should not be distractions on the top face of the box where the cloud was held. The users would look down at the instrument and the focus of the instrument would be the cloud and rain falling down. This
            would be the focus of what the users would see and where they also get their visual feedback of their actions. I took inspiration from pinball machines and placed my buttons on the left and right sides of the box , therefore giving a more natural
            placement of the hands and also taking advantage of associations users would already have with pinballs and natural hand placments wrapping around the box. Also with pinball machines you are focused on seeing the top face and what magical things are happening
            just like with this instrument. The fsr sensor was placed on the front face , following along the natural hand curve needed to press the buttons. <br><br>

            The inclusion of the leds was essential to the instrument. I wanted my instrument to be an expierence , to be a reflective tool and be a magical solitary expierence. I wanted it not only be a musical tool , but an expierence.
            The leds are a somewhat of a show to accomany the music and be mesmorized with BUT ALSO is functional in providing visual feedback when an action is created. Every "weather effect" has its own associated led effect and color. When you press any of the
            light rain or hard rain buttons it is mapped onto a led colum. Upon pressing you get the auditory feedback , the sound, and the visual feedback, the led lights up according to which button you pressed and every two seconds it goes down the colum to mimic
            rain as rain falls down from the cloud. Hard rain and light rain are similar with only differing in color of the leds. The tunder has a flashing sequence of leds with varrying colors.

      <h7> Future Considerations </h7>
      <p> I loved the final results on my product and what I accomplished but had some ideas that were orginally to be implemented be cut off. For further iterations , I would
      want to add the "snow feature" , "air feature" , and "rainbow feature" with their accompany controls , sound , and led pattern. I also want the ability to play back your recording
    so that at the end of your session you can hear your composistion and see the accopnaying led show play back again. This loop could be saved. I also had a few more details I wanted to do to my physical
  design such as different button caps and having the box have a curve. I also wanted the inside of the box to be accessible by having the top face be opened through magnets.  I am excited to iterate ! I would also
get this out to users for user testing to see if any new opportunitites for change and design to arise.  </p>
