          <h7>Introduction</h7>
          <p>The Destroy the World in a Day Simulator is an interactive arcade game built to educate consumers
            about their own decisions. Players go through their daily life making decisions
             about what to eat, how to dress, etc. and see how their decisions impact the health
              of the earth if every consumer behaved as they did. At the end of the game, no matter
              what decisions were made, the Earth will be destroyed due to environmental degradation.
               The reason players cannot win this game is because the world of the game mirrors that of
                the outside world: there is no single consumer habit that can stop us from the path of
                environment unsustainability. Solving our environmental problems will require greater
                regulation and control on businesses who produce items with costs borne by the global economy,
                 instead of the entity profiting from the sale of the product.
              We aimed to <span class="importantwords">create an intuitive device</span>
          .</p>

            <h7> My Role </h7>
            <p>In an interdiscplnary team of four,I conceptualized the idea and worked
              on the entire design process to create a fully functional final protype.
              My main responibilities invloved mechanical and visual design of the product.
              I worked on desiging, modeling, and constructing the physical enclosure as well as
              the physical interactions and design of the physical product. I also ensured maximum
              robustness and building the internal support and housing for the 20 computer monitor
              and electronics.I also assisted in research on envriomental topics working closely
              with a freind and founding member of Latinos in the Enviroment at Berkeley.</p>

              <h7> The Problem </h7>
                  <p>Design and manufacture a prosthetic for Theo, a 3-year-old boy born
                     with a ⅓ of his forearm. The prosthetic should seek to improve Theo’s
                     life and allow him to achieve tasks that would otherwise be difficult
                     for him. To create an authentic prosthetic, we would have to work closely
                      with our project partners through extensive user interviews and three
                      user testing meetings. The prosthetic should also be able to pass a series
                      of dexterity tasks and include electronic and mechanical components.</p>

                  <p>Our group was curious about: who does the burden of sustainability fall on?
                     We were keen on exploring systems, corporates, and policy instead of solely
                     focusing on individual consumers. I mentioned a YouTube video: let’s go
                       shopping & destroy the planet, by an ethical fashion activist, Kristen Leo.
                        In the video she played a video game called planet pollution; I proposed to
                        make it a physical video game as an arcade game that seeks to educate and expose
                        in a seemingly fun interactive game that will persuade potential users to particpate.
                         Together in the group we decided to conflate
                      our interest in industries and exposes the practices of various
                          industries.Together we brainstormed what industries to focus on and what the general
                        game flow we wanted. </p>

              <p> The reserach was a critical portion of our project. It was important
                for me to expand general cautious cosumption into action on participants.
                It was essential to vocalize issues not addressed in the mainstream particularly
                to enviromental  reprecussions on people of color
                The game every option will lead to destruction and it amplifies the irony
                of how some product like fruits and vegtables are politized with the
                destruction of communities in central and south america. How many times you
                play the game will end in the destruction of the planet. This asks the
                user to critically think about every choice and the poltics behind the industries
                under capitalism.

          <h7>Enclosure Design Process</h7>

          <p>The design of the enclosure was centered around 80’s arcade cabinets. The design
            followed a similar aesthetic and shape as traditional arcade cabinets. The images
            above showcase the original sketch and a rendering of the CAD model. The major design
            constraints revolved around designing on the computer monitor screen while simultaneously
            staying within in the dimensions of the black acrylic we purchased. The design was
             proportioned to fit the screen but also have it high up so that users are looking
             straight at the screen rather than having it lower in view. The button interface is
             tilted to be inclined in order to maximize space. The next major design constraint
             was the weight of the computer screen. The cabinet would have to securely be able
             to withhold the weight of the box. The approach to this constraint was to make a
             stable wood table inside of the acrylic enclosure to hold the computer screen.
             Another notable feature in the design if the front cover for the buttons and led ring.
             The design has this piece is inclined for users to have easier access to play. This piece
             can be popped on and off, made with finger joints around the edges so there is access to
             the electronics for debugging.

        <p>With these design considerations in mind, the digital prototype was
           created on Fusion 360. These pieces were cut on acrylic and wood.
           The acrylic was used to give a cleaner look and to resemble actual games.
           The final touches included decorating the exterior with vinyl cut stickers
           and laser cutting the title for a 3D effect. This design was Tetris inspired
           to reinforce the 80’s game aesthetic and create an inviting and enjoyable product
           for playing.
