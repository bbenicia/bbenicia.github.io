                <h4>ME 193C - Upper Limb Prosthesis</h4>
                <h5>Theohand is a prosthetic device that utilizes soft robotics to help our Project Partner Theo improve his mobility and way of life. Theo is a 3 year old boy born with only one-third of
                    his right forearm. Because of Theo’s young age and lack of experience with prostheses, the user experience of the device was a huge priority. <br><br> The prosthetic functions by turning a knob that
                    tightens the prosthetic into a flexible grip.The device also has LEDs and a speaker that
                    signaled different lights or sounds as haptic feedback to convey that an object was firmly grasped.  </h5>

                <h5>Destroy the World in a Day simulator is an interactive game inspired by 80’s arcade games and choose your own adventure games.
                  This game is focused on educating individuals about sustainability through the lens of everyday life decisions. <br><br>
                  Players go through a typical day making decisions about what to eat, how to dress, etc.
                  and see how their decisions immediately  impact the environment and the social , political , and economic entanglements of each repercussion.

                <p class="des"> Plant-E is an internet of things product designed to be a self-care watering system that can collect data that can be monitored on an android app.
                  The design was motivated by student’s experience with constantly killing their plants due to busy schedules. <br><br>
                  This product followed a human centered design process focusing on student’s needs,and how students interact mostly on their phones through apps and twitter.
                  Features include an interactive android app and a live twitter read of current plant updates and a Wall-e and cute aesthetic for marketability.  </p> </div>

                  <p class="des">The Wii-Kart was an interdisciplinary project that synthesized visual programming with data acquisition and mechanical design.
                    It uses the myRIO microprocessor as the controller by reading and processing accelerometer data. The myRIO VI then sends motion and light controls to both the Wii-Kart and the computer’s graphical user interface.
                    Wii-Kart is a wireless, battery-powered vehicle which moves on four omni-wheels.<br><br>

                    This product took inspiration from glowing LED balls, and aims to create a real life Mario Kart controlled in a similar way as with a wii remote.  </p></div>

                    <p class="des"> As visual thinkers, molecular models are especially useful as educational tools in introducing the fundamental backbone and building blocks that ultimately construct complex molecular structure.
                      This project aims to present an accurate translation of the hierarchal self assembly of cis-structured peptoid nanosheet and helix. <br><br>
                      The models are built to self-assemble, which aims to illustrate and mimic self-assembly in nature.
                       These models will provide more opportunities for interaction and exploration, which helps engage students and users.  </p></div>
