            <h7> My Role </h7>
            <p>My final project for Electronics for the Internet of Things, a class focused on IoT devices.
            I designed and prototyped a lovable and commercial autonomous watering and care plant system aimed
             for busy college students. I programmed this IoT device using Arduino Uno to take sensing data and
             send it to the cloud to show on a mobile  app as well as to actuate a water valve and notify users
             of water levels. In addition I created a Plant-E twitter that tweets updates as Plant-E.</p>

            <div class="Problem">
              <h7> The Problem </h7>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                  <p> College students love to buy plants and more so low maintence plants.
                    They provide comfort and bring more life to their new homes away from home.
                    Although students buy plants, they always end up killing their plants.
                    College students are extremely busy and forget to water or care for their plants
                    even low maintence plants such as succulents.</p>
                </div>

              </div>
            </div>


             <h7> Research </h7>
             <p>I created a facebook post on my college's page to gage how many students related to this problem.
             The results were overwhelming. It became a quickly trending topic with 161 comments,92 likes, and 2 shares.
           Students found it very humorous for how relatable it was that eveyone had dead plants.I talked to a few students
           and they loved the idea of an autonmous watering system and the design.</p>

            <h7> How it Works </h7>

            <img class="theoproj" src="images/flow.png" alt="theoproj4">
            <p>Sensing data is gathered, send to the cloud, gathered through thingspeak,and broadcasted on twitter and android app</p>
          <div class="key_insights">
            <h8> IoT Elements </h8>
            <br>
          Sensing(Input)
                <li> Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11)</li>
                <li> Laser Ranging Sensor(VL53L0X)- to monitor water levels</li>
                <li> Soil Moisture Sensor Module</li>

            Actuation
              <li> Submersible Water Pump</li>

            Computing
            <li> As the sensor monitors the plant's moisture and humidity,
              and water level status,data is gathered and simultaneously graphed against time</li>

              Communication
              <li> Thingspeak , Virtuino(android app),Twitter</li>
              <li> Monitor live data on app , get updates on twitter</li>
