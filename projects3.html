      <section class="design_process">


          <h7>Introduction</h7>
          <p>Finding Cuby is a cube that self-rotates from the momentum of the laser-cutted wooden cube,
            which includes a flywheel, a DC motor, a solenoid to stop the flywheel in order to provide
            impulse to flip the cube, and a Pixy camera setup to detect the color of the cube -- as well
            as the distance between the cube and the camera. Multiple cubys are aimed to self assemble
            once located through magnet attachment. The potential application can be used in assembling
            modular furniture.  </p>

            <h7> My Role </h7>
            <p>In a team of four,consisting of all mechanical engineering students,
               I conceptualized the idea having worked on self assembly models. I worked
               on the entire design process, but my main responibilities included
               harge of the mechanical design of what encompasses the mechanism : flywheel ,
                mount, motor brake system along with the programming of the motor brake actuation
                 and industrial design of the exterior. I also specialized in rapid prototyping -
                 3D printing and laser cutting along with material selection.  Each iteration brought
                 a new technical challenge that helped me mainly learn the importance of tolerancing,
                 material selection, fundamental physics , and attention to details that ultimately guide
                 the mechanical design.  </p>

          <!--photos - mind map and different design iterations -->
          <p>(1) Every element from screws,wires connections, motor used were needed to be designed to
            optimize our end goal of rotating our cube. Each iteration made our system more and more robust
            because of the attention to details. For instance, the placement of our brake depended on maximizing
             the moment arm from the corner of the cube under the geometric restrictions of our flywheel placement.
              For the flywheel design , the inertia was maximized by creating the largest radius possible while still
               fitting within the parameters of the enclosure and other components that needed to fit in the system.
               The material was also considered on mass for the minimum thickness and tolerancing for machining process. </p>

          <!-- photo -->
          <p>(2) In terms of the mount ,I had to think about not only the most robust and optimal design to fit every component
             with tolerances but also the printing process that would allow me to achieve this. It was important to consider the
              time of material used for the 3D printer, print speed, printing position , and infill to optimize strength. All
              these components mattered, since a visibly perfect printed mount cracked with the high rpm.</p>
          <!-- photo -->

          <p>(3) A solenoid pushes forward a hexagonial brass prism that forcefully stops the flywheel from spinning in order to
            trasfer as much rotational energy as possibly from the flywheel to the cube.</p>

             <p>(4) With the shaft collar,I learned to adapt when commercial
             parts aren't fitted for your project and instead customize it for your own. I couldnâ€™t
             find a shaft collar that had a small diameter to fit our motor.
                Because our system was small and compact , it influenced the size of our chosen motor
                that fit our rpm requirements. By designing the shaft collar and using the machine shop
                 as a resource, I was able to securely attach flywheel to motor along with our brake to
                  our solenoid.The new shaft collar helped with keeping the components tight and secure
                  and reduced energy loss coming from a wobbling system and optimize rotational energy.</p>

             <!-- photo -->
             <p>(5) In terms of the solenoid, it fit our project because of the direct and controllable action ,
               but required high current.</p>
