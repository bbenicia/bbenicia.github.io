          <h7>Introduction</h7>
          <p>Theohand is a prosthetic device that utilizes soft robotics
            to help our Project Partner Theo improve his mobility and way of life.
            Theo is a 3 year old boy born with a birth defect called Amelia.
             In Theo’s case, he was born with only one-third of his right forearm.
              We aimed to <span class="importantwords">create an intuitive device</span> that enabled him to do his
              favorite hobbies, such as bike riding and drawing,much more easily.
              Because of Theo’s young age and lack of experience with prostheses,
               <span class="importantwords">the user experience of the device was a huge priority.</span>
                With the Theohand, we explore <span class="importantwords">the intersection of cutting edge
                prosthesis technology with human-centered design,</span> creating a device
                that provides greater mobility but also enjoyment in Theo’s life.</p>

            <h7> My Role </h7>
            <p>In a team of four,consisting of all mechanical engineering students,
               we worked on the entire design process to create a fully functional
                final prototype. I worked on needfinding, ideation and prototyping,
                 user testing,mechanical and visual design.I implemented human centered
                  design methodology that began with extensive one-on-one user interviews
                  throughout the product’s iterations. I designed , modeled , and manufactured
                  soft robotic fingers that aided to conform to a variety of objects
                   and reduce stiffness at the initial turn for a child and designed
                   the arm housing for comfort and minimize weight and bulk.  </p>

                     with a ⅓ of his forearm. The prosthetic should seek to improve Theo’s
                     life and allow him to achieve tasks that would otherwise be difficult
                     for him. To create an authentic prosthetic, we would have to work closely
                      with our project partners through extensive user interviews and three
                      user testing meetings. The prosthetic should also be able to pass a series
                      of dexterity tasks and include electronic and mechanical components.</p>

             <h7> Research </h7>
             <p>In order to design an authentic product that truly reflected Theo’s needs
               as a child and first-time prosthesis user, the user experience was a huge
               priority and guided our major design decisions. Theo’s young age, being
               3 years old, provided a challenge for us in determining our needfinding and
               user interviews. We interviewed Theo’s father as someone who knows Theo and
               has his best interests first. Our goals for our user interviews were to
               understand Theo’s challenges with everyday tasks, grasp a sense of his
               personality including likes and hobbies, and family values. </p>

               <!-- photo -->
               <p>In addition to user interviews, we conducted secondary research on existing
                  prosthesis technology. Some products include the TBM hand, a child prosthetic
                  hand that focus on making the fingers flex inwardly independently of each
                  other, iron man hand, a child prosthetic focus on creating a playful
                  interactive hand , and open source 3D printed prosthetic arms. </p>

      <h7> Prototyping and Iteration </h7>
      <p>The focus of our product was to create a design that was easy
         and simple for  Theo and any other younger child to use. This
         would serve as an introductory prosthetic and something for him
          to adapt to. Our three meetings with Theo influenced our iterations. </p>

        </div>


          <p>During our first meeting with Theo, our main goals were for Theo to
          experience our main mechanism, the knob mechanism, and to see the socket
          fitting for Theo and gage his arm size. This was Theo’s first attempt
           and found it difficult at first but was able to adapt and learn quickly
           the turning mechanism. An improvement we made was to create a star knob
           so it would be easier for Theo fingers to hold. As for fit, although
            we had an arm casting, Theo proved to be a lot smaller, so we downsized
             our socket by a lot. </p>

          <h8> Meeting 2 </h8>
          <div class="row">
               <div class="col">
                  <img class="meeting1b" src="images/meeting2a.png" alt="theoproj3">
               </div>

               <div class="col">
                  <img class="theoproj" src="images/meeting2b.png" alt="theoproj3">
               </div>
          </div>

          <p>For our second meeting, we had a functional prototype for Theo to try.
             Our main goals were to see fit and comfort, his response to the turn
             and release mechanism, and whether he could grasp an object. Theo was
             not able to grasp smaller items such as markers but could grasp larger
             objects. To address this for our next iterations, we made the tendon
             system more taught as well as an added plastic dip to fingers, palm
             and thumb for more friction. Theo was able to pick up on moving very
             quickly and it was easy for him to do full turns. He enjoyed playing
             with the star knob. This is attributed to the device feel more
             like a toy. Kids are usually drawn to a simple mechanism such as
             turning and toys exist on the market specifically targeting these
             mechanisms already. However, he still doesn’t turn the knob the
             full way to where there is a full grasp but rather turns and then
             releases. Our next iteration for meeting 3 would integrate
             electronics, an FSR and LED feedback that signifies a full
             grasp with and this may help with these processes.</p>

      <h8> Meeting 3 </h8>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <img class="theoproj" src="images/meeting3a.png" alt="theoproj3">

        <div class="col">
          <img class="theoproj" src="images/meeting3b.png" alt="theoproj3">
        </div>
      </div>

          <p>The final iteration for Theo to try on was during Jacob’s showcase.
             In this iteration, we had implemented the electronics and wanted
             to see his response to the prosthetic in terms of ease of use of
             mechanism, functionality, comfort, and inclusion of electronics.
             Overall, Theo appeared to really like the party mode and the simplicity of pressing
             a simple button to actuate it. The Led party mode, the star knob mechanism,
             and Baymax aesthetic emphasized the toy-like prosthetic suitable for a young
             child. We wanted this to be an arm that would be cool to look at and play with.
             Further improvements include fixing bulkiness, ensuring a more secure fit,
             and a better fsr placement. </p>
